    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll learn to calculate standard deviation and variance, and gain intuition for what it means and how it can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "* Calculate Standard Deviation of a sample or population\n",
    "* Calculate the Variance of a sample or population\n",
    "* Explore the relationship between Standard Deviation and Variance\n",

    "### Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous labs, we learned about _Measures of Center_ such as **_mean_** and **_median_**.  These metrics help give us a general understanding of where the values lie in the range of our data. However, they don't tell us the whole picture, and can often be misleading.  To truly understand our data, we also need _Measures of Dispersion_--namely, **_Standard Deviation_** and **_Variance_**.  These measures tell us how tightly or loosely clustered around the center our data is, and generally act as a measure of how \"noisy\" our dataset is or isn't.\n",

    "In this lab, we'll manually calculate standard deviation and variance and explore the relationship between them, as well as their relationship with other summary statistics such as the mean. \n",

Avoid using the library's `std` function to calculate standard deviation at this step--calculate everything as needed using only basic python.  "

    "\n",
    "People often use the Mean as a summary statistic to encapsulate all relevant information about a topic.  However, the mean is just a statistic--it deserves no special relevance, and can be misleading in many cases.  An example where this can be misleading is life expectancy in the past.  \n",

    "Up until the 18th century, the mean life expectancy in most countries was between 30 and 40.  However, the number of people that actually died between the ages of 30 and 40 was actually quite low.  This average person that survived past childhood could expect to live well into the 50s, 60s, or even 70s.  Why, then, is the average life expectancy around 35?\n",

    "1.  Why did so few people actually die at the mean life expectancy age? Is the mean life expectancy a good metric or not? Why?\n",
